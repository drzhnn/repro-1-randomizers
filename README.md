# Pattern randomizer presets for u-he Repro-1

Here's a small collection of scripted presets that should make working with patterns in Repro-1 a little bit more joyful. 36 presets in total.

01 Enable Arp Mode.h2p
Enables Arpeggiator and Sequencer. Effectively turns any preset into a sequenced one, while keeping all other synth settings intact.

Next is a bunch of note randomizers. Each time you run these presets they will generate a different set of notes from predefined scales. Each preset has its own feel, and some of them are more random then the others:
02 Randomize Notes (Bassline).h2p
03 Randomize Notes (Alt 1).h2p
04 Randomize Notes (Alt 2).h2p
05 Randomize Notes (Alt 3).h2p
06 Randomize Notes (Octaves).h2p
07 Randomize Notes (Pentatonic).h2p
08 Randomize Notes (4+5).h2p
09 Randomize Notes (News).h2p
10 Randomize Notes (Tresor).h2p
11 Randomize Notes (Twins 1).h2p
12 Randomize Notes (Twins 2).h2p
13 Randomize Notes (Waterfall).h2p
14 Randomize Notes (Wild).h2p

Note type randomizers:
15 Randomize Type (Rest).h2p
16 Randomize Type (Tied).h2p
17 Randomize Type (Wild).h2p

Velocity randomizers:
18 Randomize Velocity (1-127).h2p
19 Randomize Velocity (1-10).h2p
20 Randomize Velocity (1-64).h2p
21 Randomize Velocity (64-127).h2p

This one will shuffle the number of active steps in both patterns, while keeping the length of the resulting sequence:
22 Rebalance Active Steps.h2p

The rest are helper scripts.

Duplicate stuff (if there's enough space to duplicate to):
23 Duplicate Notes.h2p
24 Duplicate Types.h2p
25 Duplicate Velocity.h2p

Transpose notes by semitones or octaves:
26 Notes +1.h2p
27 Notes -1.h2p
28 Notes +12.h2p
29 Notes -12.h2p

Increase and decrease velocity:
30 Velocity +10.h2p
31 Velocity -10.h2p

Reset parameters:
32 Reset Notes.h2p
33 Reset Types.h2p
34 Reset Velocity to 1.h2p
35 Reset Velocity to 64.h2p
36 Reset Velocity to 127.h2p

All presets except 22-25 are active pattern aware and will only affect parameters in the currently active pattern. This allows you to target specific areas using Pattern switch (1, 2, 1+2) in the Sequencer panel of the Repro-1.
